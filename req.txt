Have Modbus RTU module, that we need to continuously read ‘value’. 
C# makes steady 62-64 reads per second. 
Need source code in C++ that would make the same steady 62-64 reads per second. 
Have source code for Modbus TCP in C++ that I can provide, though it was not tested. 
All needs to be source, no modbus.dll involved. Needs to stream consistently. 
Console, updated once per second with last value read and number of reads per last second.

zip has both master and slave. 
I need only master to read slave. 
I guess we do not need socket, though need to add checksum and COM settings.
